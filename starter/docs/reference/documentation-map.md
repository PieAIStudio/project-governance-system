# Documentation Map

This is a human and AI map of the governed document shelves. It is not the AI startup entrypoint; `AGENTS.md` is.

## AI Startup Source

Use `AGENTS.md` for startup reading. It should point agents to:

- `docs/policy/*.md`
- `docs/governance/boundary.md`
- `docs/governance/ssot-v0.9.md`
- `docs/governance/doc-agent-rules.md`
- `docs/governance/doc-types.md`
- `docs/governance/agents-routing/<selected-profile>-v0.9.md`
- `docs/reference/execution/current-work.md` when present

## Areas

| Area | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/policy/` | Project policy and AI development rules |
| `docs/decisions/` | Durable decisions |
| `docs/specs/active/` | Active requirements |
| `docs/specs/completed/` | Completed specs |
| `docs/plans/active/` | Active implementation plans |
| `docs/plans/completed/` | Completed execution records |
| `docs/canon/` | Durable project truth |
| `docs/reference/` | Guides and references |
| `docs/archive/` | Retired history |
| `docs/governance/` | Governance core rules, SSOT, agents routing, doc types, templates, and manifest |

Markdown outside `docs/**` is not governed by default. Product prompts, assets,
project-package canon, generated media notes, and source-package files stay in
their product/workbench structure unless this project explicitly opts them into
doc-gov.
