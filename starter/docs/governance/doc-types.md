# Document Types

This file belongs in `docs/governance/` because it defines the document system's
own cabinets and lifecycle.

Allowed types:

| Type | Default path |
| --- | --- |
| `policy` | `docs/policy/` for project policy; `docs/governance/` for doc-system policy |
| `decision` | `docs/decisions/` |
| `spec` | `docs/specs/active/` or `docs/specs/completed/` |
| `plan` | `docs/plans/active/` or `docs/plans/completed/` |
| `canon` | `docs/canon/` |
| `reference` | `docs/reference/` |
| `archive` | `docs/archive/` |

Markdown outside `docs/**` is not a governed doc by default.

Normal documents use:

```text
draft -> active -> completed -> stable -> superseded -> archived
```

Decision documents use:

```text
proposed -> accepted -> rejected | superseded
```
