# PROJECT_NAME AI Router

## PGS Router Block

<!-- PGS-ROUTER:BEGIN v0.9 -->

## Startup Reading

`README.md` is the human-facing project introduction. Do not use it as the default AI startup path unless the task is about project positioning, public explanation, or the README itself.

1. All Markdown files directly under `docs/policy/`.
2. `docs/governance/boundary.md`
3. `docs/governance/ssot-v0.9.md`
4. `docs/governance/doc-agent-rules.md`
5. `docs/governance/doc-types.md`
6. The selected agents routing file:
   - `docs/governance/agents-routing/engineering-runtime-v0.9.md`, or
   - `docs/governance/agents-routing/doc-only-v0.9.md`
7. `docs/reference/execution/current-work.md` when present

## Governance

- Use doc-gov for governed Markdown.
- Governed Markdown lives under `docs/**` by default.
- Product artifacts outside `docs/**` are not governed docs unless this project explicitly opts them in.
- Before creating docs: `pnpm doc-gov find <topic>`.
- Before claiming doc work complete:
  - `pnpm doc-gov check`
  - `pnpm doc-gov scan --check`

## Routing

- Name this project's adopted profile: `engineering-runtime` or `doc-only`.
- Point to the chosen agents-routing file from `docs/governance/agents-routing/`.
- Engineering projects should also point to `integrations/superpowers.md` and use Superpowers inside the selected lane.
- Doc-only projects should say that Superpowers TDD and Directed Development are not enabled by default.
- External workflow systems such as Superpowers or GStack run inside the lane selected by this router. They must not replace this project router.

## Upstream Rule

Do not locally invent doc-gov core changes such as new document statuses, frontmatter schema, lifecycle rules, shared agents-routing rules, or shared AI rules. If such a change seems necessary, propose it upstream in `project-governance-system` first.
